Problem Research: We reached out to teachers and students and what we felt as a major problem is, students don't have much time to find questions relevant to the topic leading to lack of practice and also teachers are not able to create enough personalized content for students as they have to do it manually.
Students in colleges usually watch summary video of the whole topics (preferably YouTube or the college AV summaries) and go for the examination which doesn't help them much. What if! You get interactive quizzes with the video you watch, that might help you with the questions that are more likely to be asked and get a better practice and confidence.

Turn educational video lectures into engaging MCQ based quizzes and automatic assessment.
Introducing our revolutionary Transcription-based Quiz Authoring System. A cutting-edge tool designed to enhance the learning experience for both teachers and students. This innovative project will empower educators to effortlessly create engaging quizzes that cater to their unique teaching objectives, saving valuable time and effort. With an intuitive interface, our quiz generator enables teachers to customize questions, select diverse question types, and set parameters to meet the specific needs of their curriculum. Students, in turn, benefit from a dynamic and interactive learning environment, where they can reinforce their understanding of course material in a fun and challenging way. This tool not only streamlines the quiz creation process but also provides instant grading and performance analytics, allowing teachers to identify areas for improvement and tailor their instructional approach accordingly. A transformative solution for efficient and effective learning.
